# RPA Script Runner - Streamlit Application

This Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading, executing, and monitoring Robotic Process Automation (RPA) scripts written in Python. It features real-time log display, results presentation, and a simple control panel for managing script execution.

## Features

*   **Script Upload:** Easily upload your Python RPA scripts directly through the web interface.
*   **Script Viewing:** Inspect the uploaded script content with an expandable code viewer.
*   **Execution Control:** Start and stop script execution with intuitive buttons.
*   **Real-time Logging:** Monitor script execution progress with real-time log updates displayed in a dedicated section.
*   **Execution Status:** Track the script's status (Running, Completed, Failed, Stopped) with clear visual indicators.
*   **Results Presentation:** View script execution results in a structured format (text, JSON, or general output).
*   **Clean UI:** A clean and organized user interface with consistent layouts and visual cues.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.7+:** Ensure you have Python 3.7 or a later version installed.
*   **Streamlit:** Install Streamlit using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```
*   **Required Packages:** The RPA scripts will likely require additional libraries. Make sure that requirements.txt file is present in your project so that you can install the dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):** If you obtained the code from a Git repository, clone it to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (recommended):** Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:

    *   **Windows:**

        ```bash
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   **macOS/Linux:**

        ```bash
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    # If your RPA scripts require other libraries, install them here as well
    # For example: pip install selenium beautifulsoup4
    ```

4.  **Place Your `utils.py` file.**  The `utils.py` file is assumed to be present and contain the functions to execute and log your rpa script.

## Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the project directory** from your terminal or command prompt.

2.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run your_script_name.py
    ```

    Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Streamlit script file.

3.  **Access the application:** Streamlit will automatically open the application in your web browser. If it doesn't, you can access it by navigating to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Usage

1.  **Upload Script:** In the sidebar, click the "Browse files" button to upload a Python RPA script from your local machine.

2.  **View Script (Optional):** Expand the "View Script" section in the sidebar to inspect the content of the uploaded script.

3.  **Execute Script:** Click the "ðŸš€ Execute Script" button in the sidebar to start the script execution. The button will be disabled while the script is running.

4.  **Monitor Logs:** The "Execution Logs" section in the main area will display real-time log messages generated by the script. The log messages will automatically refresh while the script is running. The execution status will also be dynamically updated with an appropriate emoji.

5.  **View Results:** The "Execution Results" section will display the output of the script. The format of the results will depend on the script's output (text, JSON, etc.).  This section will be blank until there is a `result` value from your execution script.

6.  **Stop Execution:** While the script is running, a "ðŸ›‘ Stop Execution" button will appear in the sidebar. Click this button to attempt to stop the script execution.

## Code Structure

*   **`your_script_name.py` (main file):** The main Streamlit application file. Handles the UI, script upload, execution, and result display.
*   **`utils.py`:** (Required - but may need creating) Contains utility functions for script execution and logging:
    *   `execute_script(script_path, log_path, on_complete, on_result, on_status)`: Executes the Python script in a separate thread, capturing logs and results.
    *   `create_logger(log_path)`: Creates a logger that writes log messages to the specified log file.

## Notes and Limitations

*   **Error Handling:** Ensure your RPA scripts have robust error handling to prevent unexpected crashes. The application displays the logs, which should aid in debugging.
*   **Thread Safety:** Be mindful of thread safety if your RPA scripts perform operations that might be affected by concurrent execution. The `execute_script` function runs the script in a separate thread.
*   **Dependency Management:** This application assumes your RPA scripts and their dependencies are installed correctly. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
*   **Long-Running Scripts:** For very long-running scripts, the Streamlit session might time out. You might need to adjust the Streamlit configuration or consider using a different approach for long-term monitoring.
*   **Security:** Be cautious when uploading and executing scripts from untrusted sources. The application provides a convenient way to run scripts, but it's important to be aware of potential security risks.
