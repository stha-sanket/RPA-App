# RPA Script Runner - Streamlit Application

This Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading, executing, and monitoring Robotic Process Automation (RPA) scripts written in Python. It features real-time log display, results presentation, and a simple control panel for managing script execution.

## Features

*   **Script Upload:** Easily upload your Python RPA scripts directly through the web interface.
*   **Script Viewing:** Inspect the uploaded script content with an expandable code viewer.
*   **Execution Control:** Start and stop script execution with intuitive buttons.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.7+:** Ensure you have Python 3.7 or a later version installed.
*   **Streamlit:** Install Streamlit using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```
*   **Required Packages:** The RPA scripts will likely require additional libraries. Make sure that requirements.txt file is present in your project so that you can install the dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Usage

1.  **Upload Script:** In the sidebar, click the "Browse files" button to upload a Python RPA script from your local machine.

2.  **View Script (Optional):** Expand the "View Script" section in the sidebar to inspect the content of the uploaded script.

3.  **Execute Script:** Click the "ðŸš€ Execute Script" button in the sidebar to start the script execution. The button will be disabled while the script is running.

4.  **Monitor Logs:** The "Execution Logs" section in the main area will display real-time log messages generated by the script. The log messages will automatically refresh while the script is running. The execution status will also be dynamically updated with an appropriate emoji.

5.  **View Results:** The "Execution Results" section will display the output of the script. The format of the results will depend on the script's output (text, JSON, etc.).  This section will be blank until there is a `result` value from your execution script.

6.  **Stop Execution:** While the script is running, a "ðŸ›‘ Stop Execution" button will appear in the sidebar. Click this button to attempt to stop the script execution.

## Code Structure

*   **`your_script_name.py` (main file):** The main Streamlit application file. Handles the UI, script upload, execution, and result display.
*   **`utils.py`:** (Required - but may need creating) Contains utility functions for script execution and logging:
    *   `execute_script(script_path, log_path, on_complete, on_result, on_status)`: Executes the Python script in a separate thread, capturing logs and results.
    *   `create_logger(log_path)`: Creates a logger that writes log messages to the specified log file.

## Notes and Limitations

*   **Error Handling:** Ensure your RPA scripts have robust error handling to prevent unexpected crashes. The application displays the logs, which should aid in debugging.
*   **Thread Safety:** Be mindful of thread safety if your RPA scripts perform operations that might be affected by concurrent execution. The `execute_script` function runs the script in a separate thread.
*   **Dependency Management:** This application assumes your RPA scripts and their dependencies are installed correctly. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
*   **Long-Running Scripts:** For very long-running scripts, the Streamlit session might time out. You might need to adjust the Streamlit configuration or consider using a different approach for long-term monitoring.
*   **Security:** Be cautious when uploading and executing scripts from untrusted sources. The application provides a convenient way to run scripts, but it's important to be aware of potential security risks.
